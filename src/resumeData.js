On August 5th 2019 I will be starting as one of two Dallas campus mentors for their web development cohort that is beginning at that date. I decided to pursue a training in this career field because I have always enjoyed problem solving and I wanted to be able to support my family to allow my wife to work less so she could have reduced stress and get to spend the time with our daughter she expressed she wished to. I have a wife and daughter that are my core motivation to succeed. I enjoying spending my time off with them and am enjoying watching my daughter grow (she's 7 months old).",
